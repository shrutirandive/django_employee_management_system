# django_employee_management_system
Basic employee management website using Django

The system properly compares any two employees against each other to determine if they are the same Person. 
This means that if you compared two People with the same Name, Birthday, Organization and its details, the system should think that they are equals to one another. 
If any of these properties are different, then the two People are not the same Person.
